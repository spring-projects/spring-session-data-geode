This guide describes how to build a Spring Boot Web application configured with Spring Session to transparently
manage a Web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` using Apache Geode in a clustered (distributed)
and replicated.

In addition, this samples explores the effects of using Spring Session and Apache Geode to manage the `HttpSession`
when the Spring Boot Web application also declares both "_session_" and "_request_" scoped bean definitions
to process client HTTP requests.

This sample is based on a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45674137/can-session-scope-beans-be-used-with-spring-session-and-gemfire[_StackOverflow_ post],
which posed the following question...

> _Can session scope beans be used with Spring Session and Pivotal GemFire?_

The poster of the question when on to state and ask...

> When using Spring Session for "session" scope beans, Spring creates an extra `HttpSession` for this bean.
Is this an existing issue? What is the solution for this?

The answer to the first question is most definitely, *yes*.  And, the second statement/question is not correct,
nor even valid, as explained in the answer.

This sample uses Apache Geode's client/server topology with a pair of Spring Boot applications, one to configure
and run an Apache Geode server, and another to configure and run an Apache Geode client, which is also
a Spring Web MVC application making use of an `HttpSession`.

== Updating Dependencies

Before using Spring Session, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

NOTE: If you are using Pivotal GemFire instead of Apache Geode, you may substitute the `spring-session-data-gemfire`
artifact for `spring-session-data-geode`.

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the Spring Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the Spring Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-libs-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>

== Spring Boot Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the Spring configuration
for both our Apache Geode client and server using Spring Boot.  The Spring configuration is responsible for
creating a Servlet `Filter` that replaces the `HttpSession` with an implementation backed by Spring Session
and Apace Geode.

=== Spring Boot, Apache Geode Cache Server

We start with a Spring Boot application to configure and bootstrap the Apache Geode server:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-scoped-proxies/src/main/java/sample/server/GemFireServer.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, we annotate the `GemFireServer` class with `@SpringBootApplication` to declare that this is a Spring Boot
application, allowing us to leverage all of Spring Boot's features (e.g. _auto-configuration_).
<2> Next, we use the Spring Data for Apache Geode configuration annotation `@CacheServerApplication` to simplify
the creation of a peer cache instance containing a `CacheServer` for cache clients to connect.
<3> (Optional) Then, the `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation is used to create the necessary server-side `Region`
(by default, "_ClusteredSpringSessions_") to store the `HttpSessions` state.  This step is optional since the
Session `Region` could be created manually, perhaps even using external means.  Using `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`
is convenient and quick.

=== Spring Boot, Apache Geode Cache Client Web application

Now, we create a Spring Boot Web application exposing our Web service with Spring Web MVC, running as an Apache Geode
cache client connected to our Spring Boot, Apache Geode server.  The Web application will use Spring Session
backed by Apache Geode to manage `HttpSession` state in a clustered (distributed) and replicated manner.

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-scoped-proxies/src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java[tags=class]
----

<1> Like the server, we declare our Web application to be a Spring Boot application
by annotating our `Application` class with `@SpringBootApplication`.
<2> `@Controller` is a Spring Web MVC annotation enabling our MVC handler mapping methods (i.e. methods
annotated with `@RequestMapping`) to process HTTP requests (e.g. <6>)
<3> We also declare our Web application to be an Apache Geode cache client by annotating our `Application` class
with `@ClientCacheApplication`.  Additionally, we adjust a few basic, "DEFAULT" `Pool` settings (e.g. `readTimeout`).
<4> Next, we declare that the Web application will use Spring Session backed by Apache Geode to manage
the `HttpSession's` state by annotating the nested `ClientCacheConfiguration` class with `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`.
This will create the necessary client-side `PROXY` Region (by default, "_ClusteredSpringSessions_") corresponding to
the same server Region by name. All session state will be sent from the client to the server through Region
data access operations.  The client-side Region uses the "DEFAULT" `Pool`.
<5> We adjust the Spring Web MVC configuration to set the home page, and finally...
<6> We declare the `/counts` HTTP request mapping handler method to keep track of the number of instances
created by the Spring container for both "_request_" and "_session_" scoped proxy beans, of types
`RequestScopedProxyBean` and `SessionScopedProxyBean`, respectively, each and every time a request is processed by
the handler method.

TIP: In typical Apache Geode production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of servers (a.k.a. data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more Apache Geode Locators running
in the same cluster. A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the individual
server load and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct,
single-hop data access and latency-sensitive applications.  See more details about the
{data-store-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Deployment]
in the Apache Geode User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring _Spring Data for Apache Geode_, refer to the {sdg-docs}[Reference Guide].

==== Enabling Pivotal GemFire HttpSession Management

The `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation enables developers to configure certain aspects of both Spring Session
and Apache Geode out-of-the-box using the following attributes:

* `clientRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the client with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[ClientRegionShortcut]
(default is `PROXY`).  This attribute is only used when configuring the client `Region`.
* `indexableSessionAttributes` - Identifies the Session attributes by name that should be indexed for querying purposes.
Only Session attributes explicitly identified by name will be indexed.
* `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds` - controls _HttpSession_ idle-timeout expiration (defaults to **30 minutes**).
* `poolName` - name of the dedicated Apache Geode `Pool` used to connect a client to the cluster of servers.
This attribute is only used when the application is a cache client.  Defaults to `gemfirePool`.
* `regionName` - specifies the name of the Apache Geode `Region` used to store and manage `HttpSession` state
(default is "*ClusteredSpringSessions*").
* `serverRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the server with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/RegionShortcut.html[RegionShortcut]
(default is `PARTITION`).  This attribute is only used when configuring server `Regions`,
or when a P2P topology is employed.

NOTE: It is important to remember that the Apache Geode client `Region` name must match a server `Region`
by the same name if the client `Region` is a `PROXY` or `CACHING_PROXY`.  Client and server `Region` names
are not required to match if the client `Region` used to store session state is `LOCAL`.  However, keep in mind
that Session state will not be propagated to the server and you lose all the benefits of using Apache Geode
to store and manage distributed, replicated session state information on the servers in a distributed,
replicated manner.

=== Session-scoped Proxy Bean

The Spring Boot Apache Geode cache client Web application defines the `SessionScopedProxyBean` domain class.

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-scoped-proxies/src/main/java/sample/client/model/SessionScopedProxyBean.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, the `SessionScopedProxyBean` domain class is stereotyped as a Spring `@Component` picked up by
Spring's classpath component-scan.
<2> Additionally, instances of this class are scoped to the `HttpSession`.  Therefore, each time a client request
results in creating a new `HttpSession` (such as during a login event), a single instance of this class is created
and will last for the duration of the `HttpSession`.  When the `HttpSession` expires or is invalidated, this instance
is destroyed by the Spring container.  If the client re-establishes a new `HttpSession`, then another, new instance of
this class will be provided to the application's beans.  However only ever 1 instance of this class exists for
the duration of the `HttpSession`; no more!
<3> Finally, this class keeps track of how many instances of this type are created by the Spring container
throughout the entire application lifecycle.

TIP: More information on Spring's `@SessionScope` (i.e. "_session_" scope proxy beans) can be found in the
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-other[Reference Documentation],
along with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-session[this].

=== Request-scoped Proxy Bean

The Spring Boot Apache Geode cache client Web application additionally defines the `RequestScopedProxyBean` domain class.

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-scoped-proxies/src/main/java/sample/client/model/RequestScopedProxyBean.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, the `RequestScopedProxyBean` domain class is stereotyped as a Spring `@Component` picked up by
Spring's classpath component-scan.
<2> Additionally, instances of this class are scoped to the `HttpServletRequest`.  Therefore, each time a client HTTP
request is sent (e.g. to process a Thread-scoped transaction), a single instance of this class will be created
and will last for the duration of the `HttpServletRequest`.  When the request ends, this instance is destroyed
by the Spring container. Any subsequent client `HttpServletRequests` results in another, new instance of this
class, which will be provided to the application's beans.  However, only ever 1 instance of this class exists
for the duration of the `HttpServletRequest`; no more!
<3> Finally, this class keeps track of how many instances of this class are created by the Spring container
throughout the entire application lifecycle.

TIP: More information on Spring's `@RequestScope` (i.e. "_request_" scope proxy beans) can be found in the
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-other[Reference Documentation],
along with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-request[this].

[[spring-session-sample-boot-geode-with-scoped-proxies]]
== Sample Spring Boot Web Application using Apache Geode-managed HttpSessions with Request and Session Scoped Proxy Beans

=== Running the Boot Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following commands.

First, you must run the server:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-gemfire-with-scoped-proxies:run
----

Then, in a separate terminal, run the client:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-gemfire-with-scoped-proxies:bootRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/counts.

=== Exploring the Sample Application

When you access the Web application @ http://localhost:8080/counts, you will see a screen similar to...

image::../images/sample-boot-gemfire-with-scoped-proxies.png[]

The table shows 1 row with 3 columns of information.

The `Session ID` and `Session Count` columns show current `HttpSession` information including the current
`HttpSession's` ID and the number of `HttpSessions` created during the application's current run.

Additionally, the current `Request Count` is shown to indicate how many requests have been made by the client,
which in this case is your web browser.

You can use your web browser's refresh button to increase both the session and request count. However, the session count
only increases after the current session expires and a new session has been created for the client.

The session will time out after *10 seconds*, which was configured on the server using the `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`
annotation as we saw before (#3)...

.src/main/java/sample/server/GemFireServer.java
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication(name = "SpringSessionDataGeodeServerWithScopedProxiesBootSample")
@EnableGemFireHttpSession(maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds = 10) // <3>
...
public class GemFireServer {
  ...
}
----

Here, you see that `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds` is set to *10 seconds*.  After 10 seconds, Apache Geode will expire
the `HttpSession`, and upon refreshing your web browser, a new session will be created and the session count
will be incremented.

Naturally, every request results in incrementing the request count.

=== How does it work?

Well, from our defined Web service endpoint in our Spring MVC `@Controller` class on the client...

.src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java
[source, java]
----
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = "/counts")
public String requestAndSessionInstanceCount(HttpServletRequest request, HttpSession session, Model model) { // <7>

  model.addAttribute("sessionId", session.getId());
  model.addAttribute("requestCount", this.requestBean.getCount());
  model.addAttribute("sessionCount", this.sessionBean.getCount());

  return INDEX_TEMPLATE_VIEW_NAME;
}
----

We see that we have injected a reference to the `HttpSession` as a request mapping handler method parameter.
This will result in a new `HttpSession` on the client's first HTTP request.  Subsequent requests from the same client
within the duration of the existing, current `HttpSession` will result in the same `HttpSession` being injected.

Of course, an `HttpSession` is identified by the session's identifier, which is stored in a Cookie sent between
the client and the server during HTTP request processing.

Additionally, we also see that we have injected references to the `SessionScopedProxyBean` and `RequestScopedProxyBean`
in our `@Controller` class...

.src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java
[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private RequestScopedProxyBean requestBean;

@Autowired
private SessionScopedProxyBean sessionBean;
----

Based on the class definitions of these two types, as previously shown, these bean instances are scoped according
to Spring's "_request_" and "_session_" scopes, respectively.  The 2 scopes can only be used in Web applications.

For each and every HTTP request sent by the client (i.e. on each web browser refresh), Spring will create
a new instance of the `RequestScopedProxyBean`.  This is why the request count increases with every refresh,
which effectively is sending another HTTP request to the server to access and pull the content.

Furthermore, after each new `HttpSession`, a new instance of `SessionScopedProxyBean` is created.  This instance
persists for the duration of the session.  If the `HttpSession` remains inactive (i.e. no request has been made)
for longer than *10 seconds*, the client's current `HttpSession` will expire.  Therefore, on any subsequent client
HTTP request, a new `HttpSession` will be created by the Web container (e.g. Tomcat), which is replaced by
Spring Session and backed with Apache Geode.

Additionally, this "_session_" scope bean is stored in the `HttpSession`, referenced by a session attribute.
Therefore, you will also notice that the `SessionScopedProxyBean` class, unlike the `RequestScopedProxyBean` class,
is also `java.io.Serializable`...

.src/main/java/sample/client/model/SessionScopedProxyBean.java
[source, java]
----
@Component
@SessionScope(proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class SessionScopedProxyBean implements Serializable {
  ...
}
----

This class is `Serializable` since it is stored in the `HttpSession`, which will be transferred as part of
the `HttpSession` when sent to the Apache Geode cluster to be managed.  Therefore, the type must be `Serializable`.

Any `RequestScopedProxyBeans` are not stored in the `HttpSession` and therefore will not be sent to the server,
and as such, do not need to implement `java.io.Serializable`.
